## Question
I want my desktop app to navigate to the update profile page. how to get it working in dev environment?

## Answer
This is an excellent question. A desktop app can't directly render a page from your web application. Instead, it needs to open the user's default web browser and navigate to a special URL that automatically logs them in and sends them to the correct page.

This common and secure pattern is a form of **Single Sign-On (SSO)**. Here's how we can implement it for your development environment:

**The Plan: A "Login Ticket" System**
Create a "Login Ticket" Endpoint: I'll create a new endpoint on your server (POST /api/generate-login-ticket). When your authenticated desktop app calls this, the server will generate a secure, temporary, one-time-use "ticket".

Desktop App Opens Browser: Your desktop app will take this ticket and construct a URL, for example: http://localhost:5173/auth/ticket?t=...&redirect=/profile. It will then launch this URL in the user's system browser.

Frontend Handles the Ticket: Your React app will be modified to handle this new /auth/ticket route. When it loads, it will automatically grab the ticket from the URL and send it to the server to be redeemed.

Redeem the Ticket: The server will validate the ticket. If it's valid, the server will issue a standard login session (accessToken and refreshToken) to the web browser and then invalidate the ticket so it can't be used again.

The result is a seamless experience: the user clicks a button in the desktop app, and their browser opens directly to the profile page, fully logged in.

This is a robust way to bridge the desktop and web experiences. It's a slightly more advanced feature to set up.
